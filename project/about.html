		A beauty salon or beauty parlor (beauty parlour), or sometimes beauty shop, is an establishment dealing with cosmetic treatments for men and women.[1] There's a difference between a beauty salon and a beauty parlor which is that a beauty salon is a well developed space in a private location, usually having more features than a beauty parlor could have. Usually a beauty parlor concentrates on a specific treatment or beauty features such as styling either for men, women or for both. Also, a beauty parlor is a smaller and more community friendly place which is usually located at the owner's home. In some cases the owner is not only the boss, but probably the only worker, not having any other crew members. Other variations of this type of business include hair salons and spas.

		Massage for the body is a popular beauty treatment, with various techniques offering benefits to the skin (including the application of beauty products) and for increasing mental well-being. Hair removal is offered at some beauty salons through treatments such as waxing and threading. Some beauty salons style hair instead of going to a separate hair salon, and some also offer sun tanning. Other treatments of the face are known as facials. A facial is essentially a multi-step skin treatment that is one of the best ways to take care of your skin. A facial cleanses, exfoliates, and nourishes the skin, promoting a clear, well-hydrated complexion and can help your skin look younger. [2]Specialized beauty salons known as nail salons offer treatments such as manicures and pedicures for the nails. A manicure is a treatment for the hands, incorporating the fingernails and cuticles and often involving the application of nail polish, while a pedicure involves treatment of the feet, incorporating the toenails and the softening or removal of calluses.
